 Node.js Lifecycle & Event Loop — is the heart of how Node.js works.

Yeh samajh gaya toh tu async, non-blocking, API, sab kuch mast samajhne lagega. Chal ekdum se breakdown karte hain!

🔹 1. Official Definition (Technical Terms)

✅ Node.js Lifecycle


Node js refers to the sequence of phases Node js application goes through from start to finish initializtion , execution of code event handling and shut down 

✅ Event Loop

Event Loop is a core part of node js reuntime that handles asynchronous operations -- it allows node js ot perform non - bloking I/O event though its single threaded 

"Imagine Node.js is a chef 🧑‍🍳 in a kitchen. But he's super fast — he doesn’t wait for boiling water or baking a cake to finish. He sets a timer ⏲️ and moves to the next task!"

Chef = Node.js

Tasks = Function calls (like file reading, API)

Timers = Async functions (like setTimeout, fs.readFile)

Event loop = The boss that tells the chef when pending tasks are done and it's time to handle them.


🔹 3. Real-World Example


You ask Node.js: "Please read the file."

Node says: "Okay! But I won’t wait. I’ll do something else in the meantime."

Once the file is ready, event loop says: "Hey Node, now the file is done, go back and handle it."

Boom! That’s how Node.js is non-blocking and fast.

🔹 4. Lifecycle Phases of Node.js
1. Start Application
Node starts, loads required modules.

2. Execute Code
Your code (sync and async) starts running.

3. Register Event Listeners
Async tasks like file read, API call, timers register callbacks.

4. Enter Event Loop
Node keeps checking: “Any task done yet?”

5. Execute Callbacks
When async task is done, event loop pushes it to callback queue.

6. Exit
When no tasks left, Node exits.

🔹 5. How the Event Loop Works Internally
The Event Loop has phases, and each phase has a queue of callbacks to run.

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. timers (setTimeout)      │
│ 2. pending callbacks        │
│ 3. idle, prepare            │
│ 4. poll (I/O events)        │
│ 5. check (setImmediate)     │
│ 6. close callbacks          │
└─────────────────────────────┘

🔹 6. Simple Code Example to Feel Event Loop

console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("⏳ Timeout callback");
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log("📍 Immediate callback");
});

console.log("End");


output :-
Start
End
📍 Immediate callback
⏳ Timeout callback


Why is setImmediate called before setTimeout?
Answer: They run in different event loop phases!

🔹 7. Why It's Important for Job Interviews
It shows you understand how Node handles async code.

Helps in writing non-blocking, fast applications.

Core for handling API requests, database calls, file system, etc.

Common in interview Qs:
🔹 Difference between setTimeout vs setImmediate
🔹 How Node.js is single-threaded yet handles concurrency

🔹 8. Interview-Smart Summary (1-liner)
“Node.js uses an event-driven architecture powered by the event loop, allowing it to handle thousands of async tasks efficiently on a single thread.”


🔚 Final Thoughts
Node runs on single thread but can handle multiple tasks asynchronously.

The event loop is what gives Node its superpower.

This is the base of everything — from Express APIs to database calls.
