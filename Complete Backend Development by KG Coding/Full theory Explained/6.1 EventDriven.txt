Node js event driven means it listens for the event and triggers functions (callbacks), when those Events happen.

🧒 Easy Explanation:

Imagine you are the only guy at a tea stall , you don't make tea for everyone in order , you just take orders (Events), then serve tea whenever its ready - no waiting !

🌍 Real-world Example:
Button click on a website — you don’t block the page; you just wait for the click event.

🧠 Interview One-liner:
Node js Follows an event driven architecture, where the flow of the program is determind by events like user input or server responses 


const EventEmitter = require('events');
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

myEmitter.on('teaReady', () => {
  console.log("Serving Tea!");
});

console.log("Order taken...");
myEmitter.emit('teaReady');
