 6.4 NODE RUNTIME
Technical Definition:
Node.js Runtime = V8 Engine + libuv + Node APIs
It's the complete environment to run JS outside browser.

🧒 Easy Explanation:
Browser is one room to run JS. Node.js runtime is another room with extra tools (file system, server, streams) where JS can do more things.

🌍 Real-world Example:
Browser is like a car for short trips; Node.js is like a truck — handles heavy work like server, file reading.

🧠 Interview One-liner:
"The Node.js runtime is a JS environment built on V8 and libuv, providing tools for building scalable server-side applications."
