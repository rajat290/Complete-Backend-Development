Technical Definition:
The event loop is the mechanism that checks the callback queue and executes pending tasks from the event table one by one, allowing non-blocking I/O.

🧒 Easy Explanation:
A chef (event loop) sees dishes (events) ready and serves them one by one as soon as they’re cooked.

🌍 Real-world Example:
You cook rice, boil milk, and clean — not one by one, but you check each one’s status and do the next task when the first finishes.

🧠 Interview One-liner:
"The event loop in Node.js continuously checks for completed events and executes their callbacks in a non-blocking manner."
\
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout Done");
}, 0);
console.log("End");
