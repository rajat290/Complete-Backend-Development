ğŸ”¶ Topic: Streams in Node.js
ğŸ“˜ Technical Definition:
A stream in Node.js is an abstract interface for working with streaming data â€” that is, data that might not be available all at once and instead arrives in chunks.

ğŸ‘¶ Kindergarten Explanation:
Soch le ek bucket bhar paani lene ki jagah, ek pipe laga diya â€” paani thoda thoda karke aata jaa raha hai. Waise hi, stream data thoda thoda karke deta hai, ek saath sab kuch nahi.

ğŸ§  Why Use Streams?
Large file read/write without memory crash

Real-time video/audio streaming
