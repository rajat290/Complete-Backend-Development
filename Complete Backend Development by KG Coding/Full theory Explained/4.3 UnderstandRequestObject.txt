🔧 Technical Definition:
The request object (often written as req) in Express.js represents the HTTP request made by the client (browser, frontend, etc.).
It contains all the details sent from the client like:

URL

Headers

Body

Query params

Route params

Cookies, etc.

(Simple Words):
Soch le ki Express ek hotel ka receptionist hai. Jab koi customer (client) aata hai aur kuch order karta hai (HTTP request), to req object us order ki poori detail chitthi hai —
Usme likha hota hai:

Customer ne kya manga (body)

Kis table se order kiya (URL/params)

Kya extra bola (query params)

Kya naam bataya (headers)


📌 Interview-Ready Answer:
“The req object in Express represents the client’s request, containing URL, method, headers, query parameters, route params, and body. It helps the server understand what the client wants.”

🧪 Example:

Frontend sends: 

GET http://localhost:3000/user/42?role=admin


Express route:
app.get('/user/:id', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.params.id);     // "42"
  console.log(req.query.role);    // "admin"
});


 req object has:

 req = {
  method: "GET",
  url: "/user/42?role=admin",
  params: { id: "42" },
  query: { role: "admin" },
  headers: { ... },
  body: {}  // GET request usually has empty body
}

Most Used Parts of req:


Part | Usage Example
req.params | URL se dynamic route: /user/:id
req.query | Search/filter like ?role=admin
req.body | Form data / JSON sent from client
req.headers | Metadata, like tokens or content-type

Real-world Analogy:


Aap zomato pe order karte ho:

Aapka address = params

Pizza extra cheese = query

Full order = body

Zomato ka delivery guy (Express) ke paas ek request slip (req object) hoti hai jisme sab likha hota hai.
