🔸 6.2 SINGLE THREADED

Node uses a single thread to handle all the requests , but thanks to asynchronous programming and the event loop , it can handle thousands of requests without blocking 

🧒 Easy Explanation:
One waiter (thread) serving many customers — he doesn’t wait for tea to be ready. He just keeps moving!

🌍 Real-world Example:
A restaurant where the waiter doesn’t cook but takes multiple orders and serves food as it becomes ready.

🧠 Interview One-liner:
"Node.js is single-threaded but uses asynchronous callbacks and non-blocking I/O to handle concurrency efficiently."
