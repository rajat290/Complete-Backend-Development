blocking code means when we run those code who blocks thw whole main thread and it wiats until its task got completed is called the blocking code or synchronous code 

🧒 Easy Explanation:
You stand still until your tea is ready — you do nothing else.

🌍 Real-world Example:
Using fs.readFileSync() instead of fs.readFile() — app freezes for all users till the task finishes.

🧠 Interview One-liner:
"Blocking code in Node.js stops the event loop until the operation completes, leading to performance issues."


const fs = require('fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('data.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(data);
console.log("File read completed");


✅ Summary Table:
Concept	One-Liner Summary
Event-Driven	Node listens for events and reacts via callbacks
Single Threaded	One thread handles everything with async magic
V8	Executes JS code
libuv	Handles event loop, file system, threads
Node Runtime	Complete environment: V8 + libuv + Node APIs
Event Loop	Core of async: serves tasks when they’re ready
Async Code	Runs in background, doesn’t block main thread
Blocking Code	Waits and blocks everything else
