blocking code means when we run those code who blocks thw whole main thread and it wiats until its task got completed is called the blocking code or synchronous code 

🧒 Easy Explanation:
You stand still until your tea is ready — you do nothing else.

🌍 Real-world Example:
Using fs.readFileSync() instead of fs.readFile() — app freezes for all users till the task finishes.

🧠 Interview One-liner:
"Blocking code in Node.js stops the event loop until the operation completes, leading to performance issues."


const fs = require('fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('data.txt', 'utf-8');
console.log(data);
console.log("File read completed");
