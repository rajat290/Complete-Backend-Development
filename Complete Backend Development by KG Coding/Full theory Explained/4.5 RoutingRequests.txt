Backend ka heart hota hai Routing — bina routing ke server “kaunse client ko kya dena hai” yeh decide hi nahi kar sakta.

🔧 Technical Definition:
Routing in Express refers to defining endpoints (URLs) on your server that respond to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).


When a client (like browser or frontend) sends a request to your server at a specific path (like /users), Express matches it with a route and runs the associated callback function.
